Porter stemmer in Java. The original paper is in

   Porter, 1980, An algorithm for suffix stripping, Program, Vol. 14,
   no. 3, pp 130-137,

See also http://www.tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer

History:

Release 1

Bug 1 (reported by Gonzalo Parra 16/10/99) fixed as marked below.
The words 'aed', 'eed', 'oed' leave k at 'a' for step 3, and b[k-1]
is then out outside the bounds of b.

Release 2

Similarly,

Bug 2 (reported by Steve Dyrdahl 22/2/00) fixed as marked below.
'ion' by itself leaves j = -1 in the test for 'ion' in step 5, and
b[j] is then outside the bounds of b.

Release 3

Considerably revised 4/9/00 in the light of many helpful suggestions
from Brian Goetz of Quiotix Corporation (brian@quiotix.com).

Release 4
