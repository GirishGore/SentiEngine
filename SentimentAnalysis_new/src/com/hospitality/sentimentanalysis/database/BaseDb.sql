We were shocked to note that the towels were cheap and tainted and hardly what any hotel would like to claim ownership to. On complaining they were replaced by regular white fluffy ones, only to be replaced by the other variety a day later.

First Devika James then Jay Chhajalani planned the whole event really well for us.   The only suggestion I would have is that the hosts should be involved right from the beginning to discuss all details, so you know exacty what to expect.If you know what you exactly want, they will deliver!

JW Marriott Pune showcases them well, offering multiple places to sip, mingle, and enjoy the views. The Brunch at Spice Kitchen is one of my favorites, along with evening cocktails at Pashaa.

The water is the shower was not warm either. The technicians and plumbers were hard at work every day thru my stay, but the issue never got resolved until I left. Apparently, the issue was more systemic than just my room. The staff were very courteous and sincere in their attempt to address the issue. However, the upper management seemed inattentive.
